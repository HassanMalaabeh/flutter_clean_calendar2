# flutter_clean_calendar2

This package is a modified version of the `flutter_clean_calendar` package, originally created by Carlos Pe√±a. It has been modified to work with the latest version of Flutter (currently Flutter version 3.10.5 on channel stable).

# flutter_clean_calendar

# NOTE:
Due to my current job I'm not able to maintain this project anymore, it's been an exciting journey and thanks to everyone who used it.
You can now use [flutter_neat_and_clean_calendar](https://github.com/rwbr/flutter_neat_and_clean_calendar) by @rwbr who is actively maintaining his project, his package was forked from this one so be sure everything in here would be supported and more
You can find me on twitter as [@elcharliep](https://twitter.com/elcharliep)

Simple flutter calendar based on flutter_calendar package.
Thanks to @AppleEducate for his contributions.
You can pull up and down the calendar to show between weekly/monthly calendar.
It shows the number of events for that's specific date.
It shows the already Done events in other color

### Breaking Changes
* Introduction of 'CleanCalendarEvent' class. This makes the former syntax of the 'Map' that stores the events incompatible.

## Usage

Embed the 'Calendar' widget in a column. Below the calendar (as the second widget in the Column) place a 'ListView.builder' widget for rendering the list of events.

```dart
Column(
  mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.max,
  children: <Widget>[
    Container(
      child: Calendar(
        startOnMonday: true,
        weekDays: ['Mo', 'Di', 'Mi', 'Do', 'Fr', 'Sa', 'So'],
        events: _events,
        onRangeSelected: (range) =>
            print('Range is ${range.from}, ${range.to}'),
        onDateSelected: (date) => _handleNewDate(date),
        isExpandable: true,
        eventDoneColor: Colors.green,
        selectedColor: Colors.pink,
        todayColor: Colors.blue,
        eventColor: Colors.grey,
        locale: 'de_DE',
        todayButtonText: 'Heute',
        expandableDateFormat: 'EEEE, dd. MMMM yyyy',
        dayOfWeekStyle: TextStyle(
            color: Colors.black,
            fontWeight: FontWeight.w800,
            fontSize: 11),
      ),
    ),
    _buildEventList()
  ],
),

...

/// This function [_buildEventList] constructs the list of events of a selected day. This
/// list is rendered below the week view or the month view.
Widget _buildEventList() {
  return Expanded(
    child: ListView.builder(
      padding: EdgeInsets.all(0.0),
      itemBuilder: (BuildContext context, int index) {
        final CleanCalendarEvent event = _selectedEvents[index];
        final String start =
            DateFormat('HH:mm').format(event.startTime).toString();
        final String end =
            DateFormat('HH:mm').format(event.endTime).toString();
        return ListTile(
          contentPadding:
              EdgeInsets.only(left: 2.0, right: 8.0, top: 2.0, bottom: 2.0),
          leading: Container(
            width: 10.0,
            color: event.color,
          ),
          title: Text(event.summary),
          subtitle:
              event.description.isNotEmpty ? Text(event.description) : null,
          trailing: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [Text(start), Text(end)],
          ),
          onTap: () {},
        );
      },
      itemCount: _selectedEvents.length,
    ),
  );
}
```

## Properties

```dart
/// [onDateSelected] is of type [ValueChanged<DateTime>] and it contains the callback function
///     executed when tapping a date
/// [onMonthChanged] is of type [ValueChanged<DateTime>] and it contains the callback function
///     executed when changing to another month
/// [onExpandStateChanged] is of type [ValueChanged<bool>] and it contains a callback function
///     executed when the view changes to expanded or to condensed
/// [onRangeSelected] contains a callback function of type [ValueChanged], that gets called on changes
///     of the range (switch to next or previous week or month)
/// [isExpandable] is a [bool]. With this parameter you can control, if the view can expand from week view
///     to month view. Default is [false].
/// [dayBuilder] can contain a [Widget]. If this property is not null (!= null), this widget will get used to
///     render the calendar tiles (so you can customize the view)
/// [hideArrows] is a bool. When set to [true] the arrows to navigate to the next or previous week/month in the
///     top bar well get suppressed. Default is [false].
/// [hideTodayIcon] is a bool. When set to [true] the display of the Today-Icon (button to navigate to today) in the
///     top bar well get suppressed. Default is [false].
/// [hideBottomBar] at the moment has no function. Default is [false].
/// [events] are of type [Map<DateTime, List<CleanCalendarEvent>>]. This data structure contains the events to display
/// [selectedColor] this is the color, applied to the circle on the selected day
/// [todayColor] this is the color of the date of today
/// [todayButtonText] is a [String]. With this property you can set the caption of the today icon (button to navigate to today).
///     If left empty, the calendar will use the string "Today".
/// [eventColor] lets you optionally specify the color of the event (dot). If the [CleanCalendarEvents] property color is not set, the
///     calendar will use this parameter.
/// [eventDoneColor] with this property you can define the color of "done" events, that is events in the past.
/// [initialDate] is of type [DateTime]. It can contain an optional start date. This is the day, that gets initially selected
///     by the calendar. The default is to not set this parameter. Then the calendar uses [DateTime.now()]
/// [isExpanded] is a bool. If is us set to [true], the calendar gets rendered in month view.
/// [weekDays] contains a [List<String>] defining the names of the week days, so that it is possible to name them according
///     to your current locale.
/// [locale] is a [String]. This setting gets used to format dates according to the current locale.
/// [startOnMonday] is a [bool]. This parameter allows the calendar to determine the first day of the week.
/// [dayOfWeekStyle] is a [TextStyle] for styling the text of the weekday names in the top bar.
/// [bottomBarTextStyle] is a [TextStyle], that sets the style of the text in the bottom bar.
/// [bottomBarArrowColor] can set the [Color] of the arrow to expand/compress the calendar in the bottom bar.
/// [bottomBarColor] sets the [Color] of the bottom bar
/// [expandableDateFormat] defines the formatting of the date in the bottom bar

## Sample event data

The syntax of the event map changed due to the introduction of the 'CleanCalendarEvent' class.

```dart
final Map<DateTime, List<CleanCalendarEvent>> _events = {
    DateTime(DateTime.now().year, DateTime.now().month, DateTime.now().day): [
      CleanCalendarEvent('Event A',
          startTime: DateTime(DateTime.now().year, DateTime.now().month,
              DateTime.now().day, 10, 0),
          endTime: DateTime(DateTime.now().year, DateTime.now().month,
              DateTime.now().day, 12, 0),
          description: 'A special event',
          color: Colors.blue[700]),
    ],
    DateTime(DateTime.now().year, DateTime.now().month, DateTime.now().day + 2):
        [
      CleanCalendarEvent('Event B',
          startTime: DateTime(DateTime.now().year, DateTime.now().month,
              DateTime.now().day + 2, 10, 0),
          endTime: DateTime(DateTime.now().year, DateTime.now().month,
              DateTime.now().day + 2, 12, 0),
          color: Colors.orange),
      CleanCalendarEvent('Event C',
          startTime: DateTime(DateTime.now().year, DateTime.now().month,
              DateTime.now().day + 2, 14, 30),
          endTime: DateTime(DateTime.now().year, DateTime.now().month,
              DateTime.now().day + 2, 17, 0),
          color: Colors.pink),
    ],
  };

```
